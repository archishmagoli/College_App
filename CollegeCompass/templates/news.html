        <h3>The College Admissions Crucible</h3>
        <h5>Updated: May 29, 2021</h5>
        <p>Just in time for the nervous weeks of March and April when college rejections and acceptances go out to America’s high-school seniors, Netflix released “Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal,” a documentary that tells how the admissions maestro Rick Singer helped rich people, including the actors Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, cheat their kids into highly selective colleges and universities, and how they got caught.</p>

        <h3>The Persisent Grip of Social Class on College Admissions</h3>
        <h5>Updated: May 28, 2021</h5>

The University of California system says it’s trying, announcing recently that it’s dropping consideration of the SAT and ACT.

        <h3>Colorado Becomes 1st State To Ban Legacy College Admissions</h3>
        <h5>Updated: May 27, 2021</h5>
        <p>When someone applies to college, there's often a box or a section on the application that asks about any relatives who attended the university — perhaps a parent or a cousin. This is called "legacy," and for decades it's given U.S. college applicants a leg up in admissions. But no longer in Colorado's public colleges.</p>
